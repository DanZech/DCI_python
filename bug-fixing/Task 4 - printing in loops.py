# Task 4
'''Your task is to fix program non-working correctly. The problem:
there are 4 short programs with loops, that should print some numbers, but they don't work at all!
'''

'''for x in range(3):
    print(x)
'''
'''
for j in range(5):
    print(f"This is loop number {j}")
'''
'''
x = 10
while x > 0:
    print(x)
    x -= 1
'''

'''
countdown = 5
while countdown > 0:
    print(f"{countdown}")
    countdown -= 1
else:
    print("Start!")
